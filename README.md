# Bayesian GDP Growth
## Gabriel Buffet, Syrine Chennoufi, Meilame Tayebjee

Project realized for the Bayesian Statistics course by A. Simoni for the MEng @ ENSAE (Paris, France).

It runs a Bayesian regression model onto the dataset _macro_dataset.xslx_ that gathers 90 countries' GDP growth and 60 features.
We plot the posterior distributions of the parameters and try to retrieve a few **significant** predictors of the GDP growth.

The notebook is directly runnable and reproduces the results detailed in the report.

Feel free to reach out to meilame.tayebjee@polytechnique.edu / syrine.chennoufi@polytechnique.edu / gabriel.buffet@polytechnique.edu for any questions or recommendations.
